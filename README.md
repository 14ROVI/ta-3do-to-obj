# Ta .3do to .obj converter

To use this tool you do: 

```
./ta-3do-to-obj unit_name.3do
```

you need to copy the `.gaf` files from your game into a new folder in the same directory as this tool called `./gaf_textures/`

This will convert the `unit_name.3do` into `unit_name.obj`. It will also find textures used in the 3do file and extract them as .bmp files and put them in ./textures/
